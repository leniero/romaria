  Introduction

"Romaria" is an interactive art installation that merges post-apocalyptic and religious aesthetics, centered around a sacred, technologically augmented artifact.

  Concept

Set in a dystopian world after a holy war, the installation offers an immersive experience where technology and mysticism converge, using the artifact as a portal to spiritual dimensions.

  Technical Implementation

  Arduino and Sensor Interaction

- Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure participant proximity, influencing the interactive elements.
- LED Feedback: Reacts to sensor inputs by altering LED behavior, such as changing colors or blinking patterns.
- Serial Communication: Enables monitoring of distances and interaction patterns through the serial monitor.

  Processing Visuals

- 3D Fractal Generation: Creates a Menger Sponge, a complex fractal structure, using Processing.
- Interactive Visuals: The visual representation changes in response to sensor inputs from the Arduino, creating a dynamic and responsive visual experience.
- Rotation and Animation: The structure rotates and evolves over time, adding to the immersive quality of the installation.

Installation Setup

- Environment: Designed as a mystical space, resembling a shrine or a hidden sacred spot.
- Artifact Design: Combines the look of ancient relics with modern electronic components, symbolizing a fusion of past and future.

  Participant Experience

- Interaction: Engages participants physical proximity through ritual, allowing them to navigate through spiritual realms.
- Feedback: Uses lights, sounds, and visual projections to respond to closeness, creating a multi-sensory experience.
